# More advanced examples using ODEInterface

Some well-known problems described in 

* Hairer, NÃ¸rsett, Wanner: Solving Ordinary Differential Equations I - Nonstiff Problems. Springer, 1993 and 
* Hairer, Wanner: Solving Ordinary Differential Equations II - Stiff and Differential-Algebraic Problems. Springer, 1996.

are solved using die ODEInterface. For the experiments and the results, see [Experiments.pdf](./Experiments.pdf). All these examples were coded and produced by Vishal Sontakke.

## Folder Codes

It contains the standalone Julia and iJulia Notebook files for the problems as well as the separate code for plotting the graphs as PNG.

## Folder ImagesAndPDFs and Folder texFiles

They contain all the files (e.g. the plots generated by the julia examples) used by Experiments.tex to produce [Experiments.pdf](./Experiments.pdf).
