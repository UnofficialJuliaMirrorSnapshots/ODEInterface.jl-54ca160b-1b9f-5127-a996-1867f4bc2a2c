  ## Installation
  
  Because this module is an *interface* for C-/Fortran-ODE-solvers, you
  need to compile/link the solvers before you can use them.
  
  All solvers are dynamically loaded (at julia runtime),
  see `loadODESolvers`. Therefor a shared library is needed for every
  solver, i.e. you have to compile each solver and create a shared library.
  
  See `help_solversupport` for a list with supported solvers and for
  further informations how to compile/link the solvers.

  This module has its own build script `deps/build.jl` which tries
  to compile and link the shared libraries automatically.

"""
  ## Loading the solvers
  
  All ODE solvers are dynamically loaded. See `help_install` for 
  informations how to create such shared libraries for the solvers.
  
  Before using a solver for the 1st time, it has to be loaded by
  a call of `loadODESolvers`.
  """
function help_loadsolvers()
  return Docs.doc(help_loadsolvers)

"""
  ## Calling the Solvers
  
  There are two ways of calling the solvers.
  
  1. A calling convention close to the original Fortran-call,
     trying to provide/expose all the features the Fortran-codes have.
  1. A simplified version, closer to odecalls like in MATLAB.
  
  ### The full-featured calling-method
  
  All ODE-solvers have the same calling convention:
  
      (t,x,retcode,stats) = 
          odesolver(rhs, t0::Real, T::Real,
                    x0::Vector, opt::AbstractOptionsODErhs)
  
      function rhs(t::Float64,x::Vector{Float64}) -> Vector{Float64}
          if OPT_RHS_CALLMODE == RHS_CALL_RETURNS_ARRAY
  
      function rhs(t::Float64,x::Vector{Float64},dx::Vector{Float64}) 
          if OPT_RHS_CALLMODE == RHS_CALL_INSITU
  
  The input arguments are:
  
  1. a julia function `rhs` for evaluating the right-hand side of the ODE,
     see below.
     It's OK to return something, that `convert` can transform
     to a `Vector{Float64}`.
  1. the initial time `t0`. `(t0,x0)` is the initial value of the 
     initial value problem.
  1. the final time `T`.
  1. the initial state `x0`. `(t0,x0)` is the initial value of the 
     initial value problem.
  1. further parameters/options in `opt` for the solver and for the interface. 
     There is a separate section for the explanation of the options, see
     help_options.
  
  The output arguments are:
  
  1. `t` the *last* time for which the solution has been computed 
     (if the whole computation was successfull, then `t==T`)
  1. `x` the numerical solation at time `t`
  1. `retcode` the return code of the solver (interpretation is solver dependent)
  
  There are two possible ways to provide the Julia right-hand side:
  
      function rhs(t::Float64,x::Vector{Float64}) -> Vector{Float64}
  
  This is used, if `OPT_RHS_CALLMODE == RHS_CALL_RETURNS_ARRAY`. So you can
  use anonymous functions like `(t,x) -> x` as right-hand sides. But this
  form has a price: every time the right-hand side is called, a temporary
  Array is created (the result). The form
  
      function rhs(t::Float64,x::Vector{Float64},dx::Vector{Float64}) 
                   -> nothing
  
  used if `OPT_RHS_CALLMODE == RHS_CALL_INSITU` does not have this problem.
  But the right-hand side must be a function filling in the values of `x'`
  in `dx`.
  
  ### The simplified version
  
  There is a simplified calling convention (using the methods above) to
  provide a method like odecalls in MATLAB, 
  see `odecall`.
  """
function help_callsolvers()
  return Docs.doc(help_callsolvers)
end

"""
  ## The `opt` Argument: the Options

  All options are handled by `OptionsODE`. See `OptionsODE` how to
  query, set and change options.
  
  There are the following classes of options.
  
  1. Options for this ODEInterface (common for all solvers)
  1. Options for the ODE solvers
  
  ### Options of this ODEInterface
  
  * `OPT_RHS_CALLMODE`:

  * `OPT_LOGIO`:
    This option sets the `IO` that is used for logging messages

           LOG_OUTPUTFCN   log calls of the julia output function
           LOG_SOLOUT      log calls of the solution output routine

           LOG_MASS        log call(s) of the mass function
           LOG_JAC         log calls of the jacobian function of RHS
           LOG_BC          log calls of the boundary condition function
           LOG_BVPIVPSOL   log (during boundary value problems) calls to
                           initial value solvers
           LOG_RHSDT       log calls of the right-hand side time-derivative

  Different solvers support different options. All the options a solver
  supports are listed in the help-command of the specific solver, e.g.
  `help_dopri5`.

  call `ODEInterface.help_options()`.

     `eval_sol_fcn` a dummy function throwing an error if called,

     function. The return value is *ignored*.

  If supported by the solver, the numerical solution may be changed
  in the `outputfcn` (if `reason == OUTPUTFCN_CALL_STEP`) and the solver
  continues the process with the changed solution.
  The return value `OUTPUTFCN_RET_CONTINUE_XCHANGED` indicates 
  this. `OUTPUTFCN_RET_CONTINUE` tells the solver to continue (without
  changes in `x`) and `OUTPUTFCN_RET_STOP` tells the solver to stop the
  solver.

function help_outputfcn()

"""
  ## Special Structure
  
  Some solvers (e.g. radau5 and radau) supports ODEs with a
  "special structure". In this context an ODE has special structure 
  if there exists M1>0 and M2>0 and M1 = M⋅M2 for some integer M
  and
  
                   x'(k) = x(k+M2)   for all k = 1,…,M1            (*)
  
  There are the options `OPT_M1` and `OPT_M2` to tell the solvers, if the
  ODE has this special structure. In this case only the non-trivial parts
  of the right-hand side, of the mass matrix and of the Jacobian matrix 
  had to be supplied.
  
  If an ODE has the special structure, then the right-hand side 
  for `OPT_RHS_CALLMODE == RHS_CALL_RETURNS_ARRAY` has to return
  a vector of length d-M1 because the right-hand side for the first M1 entries
  are known from (*). For `OPT_RHS_CALLMODE == RHS_CALL_INSITU` the
  right-hand side gets (a reference) to the array of length d, but only
  the last d-M1 components need to be filled in.
  
  The mass matrix has the form
  
           ⎛ 1    │    ⎞ ⎫
           ⎜  ⋱   │    ⎟ ⎪
           ⎜   ⋱  │    ⎟ ⎬ M1
           ⎜    ⋱ │    ⎟ ⎪
      M =  ⎜     1│    ⎟ ⎭
           ⎜──────┼────⎟
           ⎜      │    ⎟ ⎫
           ⎜      │ M̃  ⎟ ⎬ d-M1
           ⎝      │    ⎠ ⎭
  
  Then there has to be only the (d-M1)×(d-M1) matrix M̃ in `OPT_MASSMATRIX`.
  Of course, M̃ can be banded. Then `OPT_MASSMATRIX` is a `BandedMatrix` with
  lower bandwidth < d-M1.
  
  If an ODE has the special structure, then the Jacobian matrix has the form

           ⎛0   1      ⎞ ⎫
           ⎜ ⋱   ⋱     ⎟ ⎪
           ⎜  ⋱   ⋱    ⎟ ⎬ M1
           ⎜   ⋱   ⋱   ⎟ ⎪
      J =  ⎜    0   1  ⎟ ⎭
           ⎜───────────⎟
           ⎜           ⎟ ⎫
           ⎜      J̃    ⎟ ⎬ d-M1
           ⎝           ⎠ ⎭
  
  Then there has to be only the (d-M1)×d matrix J̃ in `OPT_JACOBIMATRIX`.
  In this case banded Jacobian matrices are only supported for the
  case M1 + M2 == d. Then in this case J̃ is divided into d/M2 = 1+(M1/M2)
  blocks of the size M2×M2. All this blocks can be banded with a (common)
  lower bandwidth < M2. 
  
  The option `OPT_JACOBIBANDSTRUCT` is used to describe the banded structure
  of the Jacobian. It is eigher `nothing` if the Jacobian is full or a
  tuple `(l,u)` with the lower and upper bandwidth.
  
  The function for providing the Jacobian for ∂f/∂x can have the following
  forms:
  
       function (t,x,J)       -> nothing       (A)
       function (t,x,J1,…,JK) -> nothing       (B)
  
  The following table shows when `OPT_JACOBIMATRIX` has the form (A) 
  and when it has the form (B):
  
       ╔══════╤═════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════════╗
